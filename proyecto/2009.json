The Super Snake was announced at a test course with a large media presence, where Caroll Shelby himself raced the car to it's top speed of 170 mph (272km/h), with an average speed of 142mph (227km/h), and created a day to remember for all racing fans.", "Using a narrow-wide-narrow white stripe pattern, 10-spoke aluminum wheels, lights on both sides of the bonnet, and the well known 'Wimbledon White' body color, the external appearance of the Super Snake is not all that different to the original GT500, but the small changes alone are enough to recognize the famous car for what it is - the car that showed the world the potential the GT500 held. Only one Super Snake was ever produced, making it a vehicle that can boast both power and rarity; and a gem in both Shelby and American car history.", "The GSR American Muscle series is here to release high quality models of a number of the most famous American cars. Coming up in the line up is the 1970 Dodge Challenger, the 1969 Chevrolet Corvette, the 1965 Shelby AC Cobra 427, the 1971 Mustang Mach 1, the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and many more to look forward to."], "features": null, "images": ["images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7592/large/74d49e643e274838fb885bf6e8229788.jpg", "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7593/large/41d551aec01df5a55547e7b72f829ec4.jpg", "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7594/large/c3c44721e9443f2d34e72e1f72a0b02f.jpg", "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7595/large/4b5f0c99086a2277d400ddd7be4e8c54.jpg", "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7596/large/232d35d26de320e41d6d100d311d518c.jpg", "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7597/large/18e96d8cce785d5a2131eb32e9eb6ca0.jpg", "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2594/7598/large/34b08d798bfc4e2ae6418d948d74aa3c.jpg"], "name": "1967 Shelby Super Snake (Circle K Sunkus Limited Edition Model) (1967\u3057\u3047\u308b\u3073\u30fc\u30fb\u3059\u30fc\u3071\u30fc\u3059\u306d\u30fc\u304f\uff08\u3055\u30fc\u304f\u308b\u3051\u30fc\u3055\u3093\u304f\u3059\u3052\u3093\u3066\u3044\u3082\u3067\u308b\uff09)", "series": "1967 Shelby Super Snake", "manufacturer": "GOODSMILE RACING", "category": "Miniature Car", "price": "\u00a56,476 (Before Tax)", "release_date": "2009/11", "sculptor": null, "copyright": "\u00a9 \"SHELBY(R) GT-500(R) are registered trademarks and/or intellectual property of Carroll Shelby and Carroll Shelby Licensing Inc. and are used under license.\"\r\nSHELBY(R) GT-500(R)", "adult-content": false}, {"url": "https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/2520/actsta+Subaru+Nakajima.html", "id": "2520", "thumbnail": "images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20091023/2520/7282/large/9dedb6ecd7d7732650750331d0834f7f.jpg", "num": null, "subtitle": "The beginning of a new age of action figures - 'actsta'.
